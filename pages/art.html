        <p> <span>The art in Yemen</span> has been developed all around
            the history and from every generation we see a new
            piece of art
            The ancient history of Yemen (Yemen is also called
            &quot;South Arabia&quot;) is especially important because Yemen is one of the oldest centers
            So if we talked about the history of Yemen we cannot
            escape the history of the art just click here and read the
            article and then you will be amazed with the history of
            the Yemeni art.
            So here in this blog I will talk about three kinds of Yemeni
            art , on of those three kinds is really historical so I hope
            you like it.

            <h1>The old art <br>during some of <br>the civilization:</h1>
            <p>
                South Arabian art was born in the northernmost part of the country.
                From the region of Jawf come the first instances of an artistic tradition that at
                the beginning of the first millennium BC – in its conception – seems already ripe.
                South Arabian people show from the very first objects a perfect competence of sculpting
                techniques – they are masters with the alabaster – and remarkable skills in the
                fusion and metal working. This art, at the beginning, is modeled on geometrical patterns.
                On the heads of ibex appear huge round horns, bull’s heads are described with few lines,
                and animals’ snouts are long and sometimes substitute the animal itself, like in the
                magnificent frieze MNAO 13053. Art is often at the service of the dead. They are represented
                on stelae where generally appear their faces (MNAO 12994), sometimes only the eyes (MNAO 12998)
                or they are quickly sketched in statuettes, almost trapped in the stone they have been carved
                onto. A rich collection of these objects belongs to the Museo d’Arte Orientale.
                Traditionally called “ancestors”, even though they seem to depict the dead,
                such figures are presented all in the same position: seated, with their arms stretching
                out and clenched fists. The physical attributes and the clothes are so vaguely defined that
                in most cases it is impossible to say whether they are men or women.
                These figures tell us that for the entire first millennium BC, the
                South Arabian people are seldom interested in representing a faithful image of
                the human figures, which are often identified by the name inscribed on the base of
                the object itself</p>

            <h1>Fine Art:</h1>
            <p>There are a lot of the Yemeni Fine artists around the history and if I want to talk to the god
                father of the Fine art I can only talk about “Abdulgabar Nooman” his name in
                Arabic is &quot; عبد الجبار نعمان &quot; if you want to read about him click here ,
                so here you can see some of his art. Nooman is not the only one in his filed ,
                there are a lot of Yemenis who are so talented in this filed and this filed especially
                is different from time to another , for instance in beginning of this century the art
                was like Nooman’s art represents the situation which was relatively stable and he was
                giving a picture about the human life in that time , another example is this kind of
                art in 2011 ( the time of the Arab Spring revolutions ) the situation changed then this
                kind of art changed with the situation</p>

            <h1>Architecture:</h1>
            <p>
                The Yemeni Architecture is one of the most beautiful and historical arts in the middle east,
                what is also special about this kind of art in Yemen is that it is different from city to city
                and sometimes from village to village, I will let you now with this video which describes this
                kind of beautiful art in the north of Yemen.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="inartical2">
            <p> This video in my opinon is the most fun because it describes how genus was the Yemenis in
                Building their builds.
                And so on , If I kept talking about the beauty of the Architecture art of Yemen I will need
                more than one website to talk about it.
