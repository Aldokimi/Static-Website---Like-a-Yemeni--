            <h1>History of Music in Yemen:</h1>
            <p>Some Historians said that the first songs in Yemen appeared on the 5th or the 6th century by a
                king called ( Als Ben Zayd Dhe Gadn ) in Arabic &quot;علس بن زيد بن ذي جدن&quot;and he was on 
                of the Himyarite Kingdom (110 BCE – 525 CE) which is one of the oldest Kingdoms 
                (click here for more informations).
                So he has been called Dhe Gadn because he had a very nice voice also Dhe Gadn means in 
                Arabic &quot;the beautiful voice&quot;. Historians also says that he was the first one who sings
                about Yemen. And the author of &quot;the history of the Arabic music&quot; Theopharastos 
                (371 BCE – 287 BCE) said that there were 4 kingdoms in the Gulf of Aqaba ( this was the old 
                name of the South Arabia that time) and those 4 kingdoms was &quot; Saba&quot; , &quot; Hadramout&quot; , 
                &quot;Qataban&quot;, and &quot;Mamlaa&quot; and Eratosthenes(276 BCE – 194 BCE) said there were in the Gulf of
                Aqaba &quot;Maeen&quot; and its capital is &quot;Qaranaw&quot;, &quot;Saba&quot; and its capital is &quot;Mareb&quot;, &quot;Qataban&quot; 
                and its capital is &quot;Tamna&quot;, and &quot;Hadramout&quot; and its capital is &quot;Shabwah&quot; so form
                this we infer that there was civilization and if there was any civilization there should 
                appear with it many different kind of art!
                This was in the old civilization but for the new civilization like before 1000 Years or 
                more there were a lot of music and singing arts including poetry on of the most famous Yemeni 
                poets is Emro Alqaeis &quot; امرؤ القيس&quot;he was so great to the extent that we are studying
                his art till now in Yemen. Of course there are a lot more but I cannot mention all the poetries
                and the artists in one article. For the modern history ( the 20 century) the Yemeni 
                singing art has reached its climax so have a look at the old songs section on my article to 
                know about them!

                <h1> <span> New songs :</span></h1>
                <p>With the time of the Industrial Revolution the art of singing and songs has spread all 
                    around the word and ofc Yemen had its shear from this art. There were a lot of kinds
                    of art and like the Raï, Muwashshah , Mawwal, and Châabi music (this was the most popular).
                    I will explain one example of this kind of songs here and I will give you video as an example.
                    The Oud was is the most popular musical instrument and the Châabi music in Yemen was singed 
                    with it, I will give an example of one of my favorite songs for Abu Bakr Salem Belfkih  
                    (&quot;ابو بكر سالم بلفقيه1939 – 2017&quot;) , this song was so popular and it still 
                    popular till now, it represent a lot of the Yemeni song. I hope you enjoy listening to it</p>

                <h1><span>Old songs :</span></h1>
                <p>The new song in Yemen preserved its old heritage character and added a new update
                    commensurate with the times. With the proliferation of social media, a lot of 
                    kinds of songs appeared some of them is influenced by western culture but most of 
                    them are originally Arabic and Yemeni. There are strikingly many styles of singing in
                    Yemen: there are Sanaaani, al-Hadrami, Adani, al-Lahji, alYafei, al-Thami, al-Taizi,
                    and others. This is due to the isolation between the environments of a single
                    society. Isolation is due to the geographical topography of mountains, rivers, deserts,
                    and other isolation due to different social conditions within a single language 
                    community. I will give you here an example of the new Yemeni song and I hope you 
                    love it

                       <span> 2- Faisel Alawi &quot;فيصل علوي1949 – 2010&quot;:</span> he is a Yemeni singer and artist 
                        is considered a pioneer of the Lahji song. He was famous for playing the oud and 
                        became famous in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf countries.
                        The artist, Faisal Alawi, was famous for playing the oud with amazing professionalism,
                        and the artist Faysal stated, "I developed the oud that I play on to 14 strings 
                        and added 16 strings to it, and he is able to add strings to the oud to be the father 
                        of 18 strings." Those interested in the singing art movement in Yemen consider Faisal 
                        Alawi better than playing the oud, and even praise his method known as "Al-Faisaliah" 
                        and Faisal's Hijaziyat to play this instrument, which is present with him in all his 
                        songs and he excelled in playing it.
